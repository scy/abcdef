h2. A Better CD Encoder, Forked

Since "abcde":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCDE development seems to be quite 
sluggish at the moment, I (that's "Tim Weber":https://scytale.name/) decided 
to fork it and convert it to Git to improve collaborative work.

My personal main goal is to make MusicBrainz tagging work, but anyone who's 
willing to work on other features is welcome to do so.

h2. Branches

There are currently two public branches: @googlecode@ is a mirror of the 
what-seems-to-be-official current "abcde repository at Google 
Code":http://code.google.com/p/abcde/ while @master@ is abcdef's main hacking 
branch where all the development happens.

I'll be syncing the @googlecode@ branch as often as possible. Given that there 
haven't been any changes since over 4 months, I guess that's not going to be 
_that_ often.
