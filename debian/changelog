abcde (2.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release!
  * Defining the tracknumber now resets the first track if given a number
    different than 1 (that is: abcde -T 1 2-10 creates songs 1 to 9).
  * Modified the FAQ to reflect the changes on Marillat's repo
    (Closes: #315724).
  * Should be "space" safe: works properly when the working directory contains
    a space (Closes: #147493).
  * Repared the CD query for the discid code. When failing to read a disc,
    actually report that there might be no disc in the drive.
  * Right now, walk over the different encoders we Depends: on in Debian and
    use the one available: if a user has a FLAC encoder, abcde will no install
    vorbis-tools, so it will fail to run out of the box (Closes: #321216)
  * Added CUE support. Still experimental...
  * Added FLAC on Ogg. Still not activated, since we cannot get comments added
    as a post-process action.
  * Applied patches from Fedora Core (Credit goes to Nils Philippsen
    <nphilipp@redhat.com>)
  * Added a post_read() function to be executed before ejecting the CD.
  * Typos reported by A Costa corrected (Closes: #311463)
  * Problem with abcde being run in a directory with files containing only
    numbers solved (Closes: #313628).
  * vorbiscomment uses now "-R" (Closes: #303566).
  * "-t" and "-T" use the first track as a starter for the track list.
    (Closes: #305749).
  * Added CDPARANOIACDROMBUS option to define -d in case of using IDE and SCSI
    in case of using ide-scsi emulation layer (Closes: #290768).
  * Define metaflac in abcde.conf (Closes: #303555)

abcde (2.2.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Double quotation added to solve parsing * as a wildcard (Closes: #302904).
    Thanks to Christian Grigis for the patch. Also (Closes: #268088).

abcde (2.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * CDPARANOIAOUTPUT missed some quotes.
  * Removed some useless lines.
  * If BATCH is used with ONETRACK, disable BATCH.
  * Small typos with CDROM comparisons.
  * Logic for CDROM variable improved.
  * Version bumped to 2.2.5 and targeted to Sarge.

abcde (2.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the way we call flac, to adapt to the new times:
    --import-vc-from= to --import-tags-from.
  * DOSPLAYLIST was not included in the list of options.
  * Options passed to the encoder by using <-o ogg:"-b 192"> are now
    supported. One can modify the way abcde encodes just for the current CD.
  * Unfortunatelly I forgot to add the starting number for tags in Ogg. For
    MP3 is a bit more difficult, since it needs changing the X/YY code.
  * Also, the order of the tags in metaflac is important for the utf8 names.
    Thanks to Frederik Juul Christiani (Closes: #297482)
  * Added CDROMID in the .conf file, for reader programs that need it
    (Closes: #297005)
  * Added a check for cdparanoia when encountering data-only CDs.

abcde (2.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control
    - suggest normalize-audio, since it changed its name (Closes: #287674).

  * Does not destroy track information when a track contains "=" in the name
    (Closes: #290709).

abcde (2.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Spotted and solved a problem with the way the data tracks were detected
    (Closes: #282647).

abcde (2.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release! Let's see if abcde 2.2 gets into Sarge.
  * debian/control
    - Bumped to 3.6.1.1. No changes needed.
  * Added support for MPP/MP+(Musepack) encoding. Although I am trying to
    get 2.2 for Debian Sarge release, mpc seems safe enough to introduce. See
    corecodec.org for code.
  * Some POSIX shell corrections (making the code more portable). Thanks to
    Guillem Jover for pointing the problem out.
  * CDYEAR is also passed to do_move(), so one can use it for sorting the
    directories.
  * Small MacOS X fix, allowing directories with "()" to work. Thanks to Evan
    Jones.
    - On the MacOS X, I still do not know if abcde works correctly. If does
      not, please, drop a note. Or else.
  * DOSPLAYLIST also changes "/" with "\".
  * DATA tracks are now excluded from the ripping process using internally
    the cdparanoia "-Q" query option. If using another ripper, it does not
    work (at least there is no support for them in abcde)
    (Closes: #112692, #117412).
  * New "0" choice for "None of the above" has been introduced. If selected, a
    template is created and the user encouraged to edit it (Closes: #147683).
  * New options for when the PLAYLIST already exists: erase, append or keep.
  * Bug fixes along the code:
    - abcde.1 corrections and additions
    - abcde corrections and code reorganization. abcde now exits earlier if
      some of the options are incompatible. Also the actions are set as
      variables earlier, so we use less calls to external tools.
    - abcde.conf additions
  * The GENRE is munged now in its own mungegenre function, so that no more
    upper-to-lowercase is done (forced) except if the default is used.
  * Examples added to the tarball and /usr/share/doc/abcde/examples with two
    scripts to make abcde kind-of-a ripper daemon.
  * Add CDDB information to Ogg/Vorbis and FLAC files (Closes: #265358).
  * Added INTERACTIVE option. Set it to "n" and there you go, without user
    interaction.
  * Changes normalize to normalize-audio (Closes: #267053)
  * Copes with wav files being erased by the ripping tool.
  * Small patch to support ()'s in the path under MacOSX. Thanks to Evan Jones
    for noticing and sending the patch.
  * Added "-w <COMMENT>". Used to give a comment to a given CD.
  * Added "-W <number>". Used to combine "-T #01 -w CD #".
  * Added "-t <number>" to modify the numbering from a starting point
    (Closes: #95828). Geez! That is low bug number...
  * Added "-T <number>" to modify also the tag entries on the songs. Currently
    available for FLAC and Ogg/Vorbis.
  * Removes trailing spaces (Closes: #280382).
  * TRACKNAME now combines multi-lines from long CDDB entries.
  * debian/rules:
    - s/dh_installmanpages/dh_installman/

abcde (2.1.20-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Let's have a good abcde in Sarge" release.
  * The mungefile() function changes * with + by default to avoid creating
    directories with the start expanded to the files found in the current
    directory. abcde2.2 will most likelly contain a better workaround.
  * Correct default OUTPUTFORMAT in man page (Closes: #250649)

abcde (2.1.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New setting for the CD speed. Some drives have a higher failure ratio when
    spinning at high speed.
  * Added a pre-read function for preparations. Uses include closing the CD
    tray (Closes: #137548).
  * Added COMMENT part in OggFlac metadata.
  * Documentation update: README, abcde.1
  * Do not tag GENRE and DATE in Ogg/Vorbis if CDDB does not provide them
    (Closes: #235531).
  * Solved bug with batch encoding, thanks to Travis McKay.
  * When *DATAPREFIX was set, the playlist creation was made without newline.
  * Added >&2 redirection to visualize the "Erase playlist" question
    (Closes: #241221).
  * Added the option "-m" to modify the resulting playlist, to contain CRLF at
    the end of every line, letting some hardware players which insist with
    DOS-style files to use them. Also, added DOSPLAYLIST as a config option.
  * When using a selected, localy cached CDDB entry, we forgot to show the
    selection when asking the user for editing the choice. Now we show it.
  * Improved the logic in the order of events when using a local CDDB repo.

abcde (2.1.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * EDITOR is called now evaluating the variable, so it works with full path
    and arguments.
  * Patch for making md5sum a variable (since some systems use a different
    name).
  * Correction by "huf" <mihi at mail.eol.hu>. The test code in line 376
    needed some quotes.
  * The PADDING code and some CDDB funcions were *really* messy. Now it looks
    cleaner, works faster and some not needed network operations are no
    longer performed when we are working with local CDDB repositories.
  * Added "-V" for extra verbosity (on slow networks the user might be waiting
    and wondering is somethins is happening).
  * Solved a bug with the non-interactive code.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Mon, 16 Feb 2004 00:13:12 +0000

abcde (2.1.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Solved the problem with re-runs of multiple choices not showing all the
    choices (Closes: #228405) (this was a quick one)
  * We now show the selected CDDB entry on a second run, instead of all of
    them (not that one should stop abcde, but just in case). This way
    consecutive interrupted runs obtain the same results.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Sun, 18 Jan 2004 22:42:15 +0000

abcde (2.1.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check if normalizer is found in the PATH (Closes: #228014)
  * Added (commented) bits to check if the CD being processed is the CD on the
    tray, so that if differs we do not eject it.
  * Store locally the CDDB information, under $HOME/.cddb since it is being
    used by Grip (at least). PATH is user defined (Closes: #88048)
  * If you are using cdda2wav and SCSI drives, you can set CDROMID for the
    SCSI drive, since it differs from the cd-discid CDROM parameter
    (Closes: #121987).
  * MacOSX keeps on failing because the OS mounts the CD before we finish
    ripping it... or something else. Please, test test test the code, and
    report your findings. Pretty please. I have not been able to make it work
    with the reports I have received.

 -- Jesus Climent <jesus.climent@hispalinux.es>  Fri, 16 Jan 2004 12:06:07 +0000

abcde (2.1.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Urgent fixes for the FreeBSD and MacOSX bits. When using cdda2wav, the
    CDROM variable must be modified depending on the device interface. By now
    we will not try to be very smart.
  * Added a test for HTTPGETOPTS since it cannot be empty for the default
    HTTPGET options.
  * Quick release to fix a problem with the CDROM detection code.
    (Closes: #226647)
  * Cleaned a bashism. Thanks to Klaus Ethgen (Closes: #226782).
  * Rewrote some parts of the cdda2wav code. Since I do not have a machine
    where cdda2wav works, I cannot test the code. The modifications have been
    done following user reports. If you use cdda2wav and abcde does not work
    for you, please, contact me and we will try to sort things out. Thanks.

abcde (2.1.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * INLINETAG and STARTTRACKNUMBER flags added.
  * CDROM checking is now done with a bit more wiselly (Closes: #219768)
  * HTTPGET is only requested is "cddb" action is performed.
  * Workout the possibility of cdparanoia erasing our wav files
    (Closes: #172694)
  * The default answer for editing CDDB data is now "y" if the disk is
    unknown. If not, the default is "n". Requested by Ricky Buchanan.
  * Now we do not erase silently any previous $PLAYLISTFILE left behind by a
    previous CD ripping (Closes: #220753)
  * Write info file with cdda2wav (Closes: #187702).
    I do not use cdda2wav myself (me is cd-paranoid) so if anyone using
    cdda2wav has a problem with this, please, report.
  * CDROM comes in 1,0,0 kind of format for cdda2wav ripper. Corrected with a
    quick patch. Kudos go to Mikhail Manuilov <viper5k at pisem dot net> for
    noticing.
  * Merged bits to make abcde work under MacOSX. Thanks to Evan Jones.
  * Merged bits to avoid FreeDB people anger and to cut down the "abcde." part
    of the discid. Now you can set the "-C" command with the directory name.
    Kudos go to Bart Samwel.
  * Added some info bits to the config file about normalize, requested by
    Ricky Buchanan.
  * Added some testing for the wav file before normalizing, to check that the
    file is actually there.

  * One head was missing a "-n". N-less heads should be cut already.
  * Not use relative links when PLAYLISTDATAPREFIX is set (Closes: #165368)
  * Stupid use of $OUTPUTTYPE in flac tagging (Closes: #218625)
  * Small typo in KEEPWAVS check (Closes: #216551)
  * "Dirty" hack provided by Ben Finney to get rid of the tags in Ogg/Speex
    encoding, when the user does not specify it as an action (lol! someone is
    using Ogg/Speex :) (Closes: #219070)
  * metaflac path was hardcoded. Now it must be in the path.
  * TAGGER, VORBISCOMMENT and METAFLAC information tools are now dependent upon
    "tag" action. There is no need to have them if we are not going to
    comment.
  * A bunch of small fixes, all along.

  * metaflac path corrected (Closes: #206110)
  * Hopefully this version repairs the comment part for Ogg/Vorbis files.
  * If nothing breaks, 2.2 will be released as soon as the KNOWNBUG is solved.
  * Removed all the inline tagging since it breaks the action chain, except
    in Ogg/Speex. Need to check if "vorbiscomment" can be used for it.
    (Closes: #206311)
  * Added DISTMP3NICE variable, to nice the distmp3 program (Closes: #208398)

    + id3v2 should work now with -c for comments (Closes: #199949)
    + small bug with batch encoding
    + Variables are exported before the CDDB functions are called, so they

      Also FLAC now uses CDGENRE and CDYEAR for tagging.
  * Debian specific:
    + Standards to 3.6.0. No changes needed.
    + Changed Build-Depends to -Indep, since this is a POSIX shell script.
  * tail/head change: -1 has been deprecated. Noted by Stephan Kulow.

    fetch.
  * More FreeBSD specific bits: CDROM and EJECT changes.
  * Typo in abcde.conf
  * Added CDDBPROTO for specifying the protocol level of the cddb query.
  * CDDB protocol upgraded to 5. CDYEAR and CDGENRE are now used for CD

abcde (2.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documentation updates: Closes: #186230.
  * Usual set of bug fixes and corrections.
  * Default behaviour of VAOUTPUTFORMAT output changed to avoid multiple
    directories for a same album. I think the format is more logical, and you
    can always split the files once they are created.
  * Padding track wavs with 0 so if you want to burn those wavs just cdrecord
    *.wav will do it. Use "-p" to force it when encoding a small (<9) number
    of files (Closes: #111627).
  * Added "KEEPWAVS" as a variable to keep those wavs. Default is "no". Can
    use also "-k" in the command line. (Closes: #160372).
    This probably should be changed with an option to move the wav files to
    another directory instead of just keep de abcde.<cdid> directory.
  * Added documentation comments about OUTPUTTYPE (Closes: #184963).
  * abcde.conf cleanup: (Closes: #186230, #187400).
